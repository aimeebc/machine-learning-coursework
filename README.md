# Machine Learning Coursework
Here you will find my .ipynb notebooks containing the completed coursework for four Coursera Machine Learning courses I audited. I completed the coursework for these courses between September 2016 and
January 2017. I am in the process of annotating the notebooks to make it clear which parts are my work, please check back soon!

The courses are:
  * Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
  * Machine Learning: Regression
  * Machine Learning: Classification
  * Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval

These courses were written and delivered by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox, both Amazon Professors of Machine Learning with the University of Washington. Further information about the courses can be found over at the [Coursera page.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning#about)

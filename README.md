# Machine Learning Coursework
Here you will find my ipnyb notebooks containing the completed coursework for four Coursera Machine Learning courses I audited. 

The courses are:
  * Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach
  * Machine Learning: Regression
  * Machine Learning: Classification
  * Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval

These courses were written and delivered by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox, both Amazon Professors of Machine Learning with the University of Washington. Further information about the courses can be found over at the [Coursera page.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning#about)
